# Black Mesa Low Spec CFGs
<br>A repository containing two lowspec autoexec cfgs. May receive changes on Black Mesa's official release.

<br>The flashlight button has been replaced with a command to enable "mat_fullbright 1", as flashlight is broken after doing the tweaks.

<br>Enabling Fake Flashlight: "F" button
<br>Disabling Fake Flashlight: "G" button

<br>Things to consider while tweaking this game:

<br>-r_lod 4 or higher makes barnacles invisible, which can definitely destroy the gameplay.

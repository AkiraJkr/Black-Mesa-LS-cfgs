# Black Mesa Low Spec CFGs
A repository containing two lowspec autoexec cfgs. May receive changes on Black Mesa's official release.

The flashlight button has been replaced with a command to enable "mat_fullbright 1", as flashlight is broken after doing the tweaks.

Enabling Fake Flashlight: "F" button
Disabling Fake Flashlight: "G" button

Things to consider while tweaking this game:

<br>-r_lod 4 or higher makes barnacles invisible, which can definitely destroy the gameplay.
